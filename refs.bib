@article{murray2017delayedsampling,
	Abstract = {We introduce a dynamic mechanism for the solution of analytically-tractable substructure in probabilistic programs, to reduce variance in Monte Carlo estimators. For inference with Sequential Monte Carlo, it yields improvements such as locally-optimal proposals and Rao-Blackwellization, with little modification to model code necessary. A directed graph is maintained alongside the running program, evolving dynamically as the program triggers operations upon it. Nodes of the graph represent random variables, and edges the analytically-tractable relationships between them (e.g. conjugate priors and affine transformations). Each random variable is held in the graph for as long as possible, sampled only when used by the program in a context that cannot be resolved analytically. This allows it to be analytically conditioned on as many observations as possible before sampling. We have implemented the approach in both Anglican and a new probabilistic programming language named Birch. We demonstrate it on a number of small examples, and a larger mixed linear-nonlinear state-space model.},

@article{fearnhead2004dpparticle,
	Abstract = {We consider the analysis of data under mixture models where the number of components in the mixture is unknown. We concentrate on mixture Dirichlet process models, and in particular we consider such models under conjugate priors. This conjugacy enables us to integrate out many of the parameters in the model, and to discretize the posterior distribution. Particle filters are particularly well suited to such discrete problems, and we propose the use of the particle filter of Fearnhead and Clifford for this problem. The performance of this particle filter, when analyzing both simulated and real data from a Gaussian mixture model, is uniformly better than the particle filter algorithm of Chen and Liu. In many situations it outperforms a Gibbs Sampler. We also show how models without the required amount of conjugacy can be efficiently analyzed by the same particle filter algorithm.},

	Abstract = {Normalized random measures with independent increments are a general, tractable class of nonparametric prior. This paper describes sequential Monte Carlo methods for both conjugate and non-conjugate nonparametric mixture models with these priors. A simulation study is used to compare the efficiency of the different algorithms for density estimation and comparisons made with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The SMC methods are further illustrated by applications to dynamically fitting a nonparametric stochastic volatility model and to estimation of the marginal likelihood in a goodness-of-fit testing example.},

We also give complete, self contained proofs of the three basic results for Dirichlet measures: 1. The Dirichlet measure is a probability measure on the space of all probability measures. 2. It gives probability one to the subset of discrete probability measures. 3. The posterior distribution is also a Dirichlet measure.},

	algorithm generally requires significant
	model-specific analysis, and these efforts can hinder
	and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a

	paper, we present a "black box" variational inference
	algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many
	models with little additional derivation. Our method
	is based on a stochastic optimization of the
	variational objective where the noisy gradient is
	computed from Monte Carlo samples from the
	variational distribution. We develop a number of
	methods to reduce the variance of the gradient,
	always maintaining the criterion that we want to
	avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate
	our method against the corresponding black box
	sampling based methods. We find that our method
	reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster
	than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that
	Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily
	explore a wide space of models by quickly
	constructing and evaluating several models of

	Abstract = {The development of probabilistic inference techniques
	has made considerable progress in recent years, in
	particular with respect to exploiting the structure
	(e.g., factored, hierarchical or relational) of
	discrete and continuous problem domains. We show that
	these techniques can be used also for solving Markov
	Decision Processes (MDPs) or partial observable MDPs
	(POMDPs) when formulated in terms of a structured
	dynamic {B}ayesian network (DBN). The approach is based
	on an equivalence between maximization of the
	expected future return in the time-unlimited MDP and
	likelihood maximization in a related mixture of
	finite-time MDPs. This allows us to use expectation
	maximization (EM) for computing optimal policies,
	using arbitrary inference techniques in the E-step.
	Unlike previous approaches we can show that this
	actually optimizes the discounted expected future
	return for arbitrary reward functions and without
	assuming an ad hoc finite total time. We first
	develop the approach for standardMDPs and demonstrate
	it using exact inference on a discrete maze and
	{Gaussian} belief state propagation in non-linear
	stochastic optimal control problems. Then we present
	an extension for solving POMDPs. We consider an agent
	model that includes an internal memory variable used
	for gating reactive behaviors. Using exact inference

	Abstract = {Policy search is a subfield in reinforcement learning
	which focuses on finding good parameters for a given
	policy parametrization. It is well suited for
	robotics as it can cope with high-dimensional state
	and action spaces, one of the main challenges in
	robot learning. We review recent successes of both
	model-free and model-based policy search in robot
	learning. Model-free policy search is a general
	approach to learn policies based on sampled
	trajectories. We classify model-free methods based on
	their policy evaluation strategy, policy update
	strategy, and exploration strategy and present a
	unified view on existing algorithms. Learning a
	policy is often easier than learning an accurate
	forward model, and, hence, model-free methods are
	more frequently used in practice. However, for each
	sampled trajectory, it is necessary to interact with
	the robot, which can be time consuming and
	challenging in practice. Model-based policy search
	addresses this problem by first learning a simulator
	of the robot's dynamics from data. Subsequently, the
	simulator generates trajectories that are used for
	policy learning. For both model-free and model-based
	policy search methods, we review their respective
	properties and their applicability to robotic
	systems.},
